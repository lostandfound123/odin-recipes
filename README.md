This is an exercise to write meaningful commit message on a html/css project.
The 7 rules of writing commit message:
- Seperate subject from body with a blank line
- Limit the subject line to 50 characters
- Capitalize the subject line
- Do not end the subject line with a period
- Use the imperative mood in the subject line
- Wrap the body at 72 characters
- Use the body to explain what and why vs how
